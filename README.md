# ElevatorSimulator

## Overview
This program simulates a single elevator operating within a building.
It demonstrates how the elevator processes passenger requests and moves between floors.

## Instructions

1. **Create a new project** in your IDE.
2. Add the `elevatorsystem` package folder and the `Simulation.java` file to your `src` folder.
3. **Compile and run** the program.
4. The simulation is **hardcoded** and does **not take user input**.
5. To modify the simulation (e.g., range of floors, elevator starting floor), **edit** the `Simulation.java` file directly.
6. The program will print the **start of the simulation**, all **events** that occur during the simulation, and the **end of the simulation**.
7. **Repeat Step 3** to run additional simulations.
